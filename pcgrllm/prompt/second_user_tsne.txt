# The Task
Your task is to fix the generated reward function for the PCG agent which works in the Raid environment.
In order to maximize the fun of multiplayer games, it is possible to express different skills for the four players being generated.
The goal is to find insights that can diversify the parameter of four player agents and write code that measure how the skill and stats of the four agents (Agent0, 1, 2, and 3) clearly distinct.
Note that the PCG agent revises the game setting of one of the player agents in round-robin manner.
Accordingly, the reward function should evaluate the playtesting result and compare the improvement with previous result.

We will provide the image.
The image below represents the parameter values of a player agent generated through a reinforcement learning process.
There are a total of four players in this raid game, and each player has seven parameters, such as damage, cooltime, etc.
The image below is a graph that uses t-SNE to reduce the parameters of the players to two dimensions.

Based on the graph, you need to provide feedback on how the reward function should be adjusted.
Now, I will provide a detailed explanation of the graph.

First, the x and y axes of the graph represent the two values when the seven parameters are reduced to two dimensions.
The parameters of each of the four agents are represented as points in a 2D space, with each of the four agents being displayed in different colors.
The values for a total of 100 samples are represented on the graph.

Your goal is to provide feedback to create a reward function that ensures the values are widely distributed, thus guaranteeing the diversity of skills generated.
The graph image will be input at the end.

You should provide insights into what considerations should be taken into account when creating the reward function.

Next, I will show you the reward function provided in the previous step below.
After reviewing this reward function, please rewrite an updated version that aligns with the insights you identified earlier.
Additionally, if any errors occurred in the previous reward function, the error message will also be provided.
Please reflect this information when updating the reward function as well.

## Previous Code
This is the Previous reward function code.
```python
{previous_reward_function}
```
{error_description}

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
(1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
(2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
(3) Do not write comments in the code.
(4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
(5) All nested functions must accept only one argument, 'kwarg'. They must not accept any other arguments under any circumstances.
(6) In the reward function you create, do not change the form of 'reward = compute_reward(kwarg['Current'])' inside the 'if __name__ == "__main__"' block. Ensure that only the argument value of 'kwarg['Current']' is used.
