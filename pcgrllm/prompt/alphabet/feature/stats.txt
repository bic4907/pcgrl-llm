### 'prev_array' and 'curr_array': (dict[int]): ({stats_keys})

prev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level
curr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level

** Global Features (Values in `jnp.array`) **
1. **DIAMETER** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The longest distance between any two points within the level, normalized.

2. **N_REGIONS** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The number of distinct regions within the level.

3. **H_SYMMETRY** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The degree of symmetry when the level is reflected horizontally.

4. **V_SYMMETRY** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The degree of symmetry when the level is reflected vertically.

5. **LR_DIAGONAL_SYMMETRY** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The degree of symmetry when the level is reflected along the left-to-right diagonal.

6. **RL_DIAGONAL_SYMMETRY** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The degree of symmetry when the level is reflected along the right-to-left diagonal.

7. **LARGEST_COMPONENT** (Scalar, shape: `(1,)`)
   - The size of the largest connected component, normalized to the level size.

Usage: h_symmetry = curr_stats['H_SYMMETRY']

** Regional Features (4x4 array per region) **
1. **EMPTY_RATE** (4x4 array, shape: `(4, 4)`)
   - The proportion of empty blocks in each 4x4 subregion of the level.

2. **SHANNON_ENTROPY** (4x4 array, shape: `(4, 4)`)
   - The Shannon entropy for each 4x4 subregion, reflecting the diversity of patterns.

Usage: empty_arr = curr_stats['EMPTY_RATE']; empty_arr[:, 0]
