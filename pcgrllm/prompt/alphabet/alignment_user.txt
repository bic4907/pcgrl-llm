Here is your generated reward function and the result of the code execution with random action agent.
Consider the scale (magnitude) of the reward function output and sparsity of the rewards when designing your reward function.
Rather than change large part of the reward function, you can add or adjust some weights to the existing reward function.

### Reward Function Code

{reward_function}

### Code Result

{rollout_result}

{error_prompt}

### Response: Revised Reward Function Code
