# PCG Agent Reward Function Generation Task
You are a reward function engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.


## PCGRL Environment
The gym-pcgrl project provides an environment for Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL), where agents learn to generate game levels.
One of the environments, "binary," involves creating maps using given tile types.
In the "narrow" representation, the agent modifies the map by scanning through it, changing tiles one by one.
This localized approach encourages more precise level design.
The agent receives rewards based on how well the generated level meets the predefined objectives.
If the agent generates a level that aligns closely with the goal—such as creating a functional and balanced map—it receives a higher reward.
This reward-driven mechanism incentivizes the agent to improve its design strategies over time, learning to create optimal levels through trial and error.


## Reward Function
The reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.
The function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.
