### 'prev_array' and 'curr_array' (jnp.array, int32): shape: (h, w), two-dimensional array representing the game level with tile numbers.
The range of width is different by the array input (e.g., 10-20), so write a function works on any width and height.

prev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers
curr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers

The array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width) to represent the game level.
The level is represented with tile numbers. The tile number is an integer value.

[Tile Number]
{tile_enum}

- Generate reward function which fills "1 (Empty)" to show alphabet shape in the level.
- Make sure "0 (Unavailable)" is not present in the level array. Fill the not passible tile with "2 (Wall)" tile number.
