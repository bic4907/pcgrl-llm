Evaluate why the current reward function is producing these game levels by analyzing how the reward structure influences the design decisions made by the AI.
For each of the following aspects, explain what may be causing potential issues and how modifying the reward system could lead to better outcomes.

The following content was generated based on the current reward function.
Review the generated levels and identify common problems appeared in the contents.

** Step-by-Step Analysis **
1. Review multiple generated levels and pinpoint common problems among the contents.
2. Decide **one** certain problem and analysis why the current reward function is causing this issue.
   If the PCGRL fails to trained, it could be a sparse reward problem. You can imagine the reward value and the reward frequency of previous one.
   One other problem could be overfitting on a specific action; repeatedly placing a tile excessively will result in excessive rewards for only certain actions.
   Since it is difficult to predict the reward value of a complex reward function, if there is a problem with learning, you can change it to a simple reward function.
3. Pinpoint the problem parts of the previous reward function give a plan to revise the reward function. Give me the only changed part reward function.
