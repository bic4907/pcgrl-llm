The task is to generate a map that fits the scenario. The reward function should provide higher rewards for maps that closely resemble the scenario.
The reward function takes a level array as input and returns a reward value.

Target scenario: {target_character}

Ensure that the generated map includes a reasonable number of monsters and keys.
First, create a reward function that minimizes the generation of monsters other than those mentioned above.
Second, design reward function so that the map does not contain an excessive number of monsters or keys.
