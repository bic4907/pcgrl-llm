Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
(1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
(2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
(3) Write some commend for each sub-function what the agents characteristics' is determined and how to calculated it.
(4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
(5) All nested functions must accept only one argument, 'kwarg'. They must not accept any other arguments under any circumstances.
(6) In the reward function you creats, do not change the form of 'reward = compute_reward(kwarg['Current'])' inside the 'if __name__ == "__main__"' block. Ensure that only the argument value of 'kwarg['Current']' is used.
