** Step-by-Step Analysis **

1. Identify Common Issues:
Review multiple generated levels and pinpoint recurring problems. Are there common design flaws, such as repetitive layouts, misplaced obstacles?
Provide **one or two certain issue** that you found in the generated content.

2. Assess the Root Cause:
For each issue, trace back to the potential reward function component responsible for encouraging or failing to discourage such outcomes.
You should cite the specific part of the reward function that may be causing the issue.
