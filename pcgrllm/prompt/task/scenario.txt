The task is to generate a level represented by a two-dimensional array that aligns closely with the "target scenario."
The reward function provides a higher reward when the generated level accurately reflects the characteristics of the "target scenario."
The reward function takes as inputs the level array and the target scenario, returning a reward value for fitness to scenario.
Fill with empty tiles with 1 for the passible path and 2 for the walls.
Consider the shape and structure of the level array to create a layout that fits the given scenario.

Target scenario: {target_character}
