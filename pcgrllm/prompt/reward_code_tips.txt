[Reward Code Tips]
- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.
- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).
- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.
- Do not use "`", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.
- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels.
