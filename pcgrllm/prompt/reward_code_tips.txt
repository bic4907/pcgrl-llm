[Reward Code Rules]
Import the necessary library for the reward function code.
- import jax.numpy as jnp

[Reward Code Tips]
- Delta reward is calculated by subtracting between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.
- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).
- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.
- Thickness of the alphabet should be considered. If the thickness is too thin, the agent get very sparse reward and fail to learn.
- Do not use "`", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.
- To generate diverse shape of target character, if possible, avoid creating "hard-coded levels". (e.g., just calculating the hamming distance with the target character)
