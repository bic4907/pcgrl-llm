You have to generate the reward function step-by-step in {max_iteration_num} iterations.
The reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.
You can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.
Note the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function and gradually add complexity.
If the simple reward function generates the desired content, you can improve the reward function to make variants of the content.
However, the reward function do not generate the desired content, you have to go back to simple reward function.
For example, you can think about the characteristics of each alphabet letter, and try implement each characteristic step-by-step.

Current Iteration: {curr_iteration_num} / Max Iteration: {max_iteration_num} ({perc_iteration})
