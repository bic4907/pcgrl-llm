You have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.
The reward function is revised trial-and-error and could get feedback on end of each iteration.
For example, you can starts with a simple reward function and then add more conditions to make it more complex.
If the complex reward function doesn't work well, you can simplify it again.
In the first iteration, you should start with a very simple reward function and then add more conditions to make the content more diverse.

Current Iteration: {curr_iteration_num} / Max Iteration: {max_iteration_num} ({perc_iteration})
