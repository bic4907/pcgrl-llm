You have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.
The reward function is revised trial-and-error and could get feedback on end of each iteration.
In the early stage, starts with a very simple reward function and dense reward function;
After the complete content is generated well, then you can try to make the reward function more complex to enhance diversity.

Current Iteration: {curr_iteration_num} / Max Iteration: {max_iteration_num} ({perc_iteration})
