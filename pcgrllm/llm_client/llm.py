If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Individual Variables\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.SurviveTime` - The survival time of Agent {i} during playtesting.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Distance.Moved.PerSecond` - The average distance moved per second by Agent {i}.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Distance.Boss.Mean` - The average distance of Agent {i} from the boss entity.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Damage.Dealt.PerSecond` - The average damage dealt per second by Agent {i}.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Damage.Taken.PerSecond` - The average damage taken per second by Agent {i}.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Armored.PerSecond` - The change in armor status per second for Agent {i}.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Health.Last.Ratio` - The ratio of Agent {i}'s last health value to its maximum health.\n`Playtesting.Agent{i}.Skill.Used.PerSecond` - The average usage of the specific skill per second by Agent {i}.\n\nThe playtested values are min-max normalized for each variable. The values are normalized to the range of [0, 1].\nThere are four player agents in the game and the index of the player agent is from 0 to 3. (e.g., Agent0, Agent1, Agent2, Agent3)\nThe example of the key name is \"Playtesting.Agent0.SurviveTime\" for the survival time of Agent0.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef compute_reward(kwarg):\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    # start of code\n    def reward_1(kwarg):\n        return 0.0\n\n    def reward_2(kwarg):\n        return 0.0\n\n    def reward_3(kwarg):\n        return 0.0\n\n\n    reward = reward_1(kwarg) + reward_2(kwarg) + reward_3(kwarg)\n    # end of code\n\n    return reward\n\n\n# Do not edit this part (start)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        json_path = sys.argv[1]\n\n        with open(json_path, 'r') as f:\n            kwarg = json.load(f)\n\n        reward = compute_reward(kwarg['Current'])\n        print(reward)\n    except IndexError:\n        print(\"Error: No argument provided.\")\n# Do not edit this part (end)\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\nThe 'compute_reward' function is composed by summing the results from multiple reward terms, such as reward_1, reward_2 ...\nSimilar to the template provided, it is necessary to create functions within the function, and the number of functions does not matter.\nThe function receives the playtested results and returns the reward value in float.\nThe function should be implemented in the \"compute_reward\" function.\nThe reward shaping code should be written between '# start of code' and '# end of code' comments.\nThe code output should be formatted as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\"."

Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n(3) Do not write comments in the code.\n(4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n(5) All nested functions must accept only one argument, 'kwarg'. They must not accept any other arguments under any circumstances.\n(6) In the reward function you creats, do not change the form of 'reward = compute_reward(kwarg['Current'])' inside the 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"' block. Ensure that only the argument value of 'kwarg['Current']' is used.\n\n<INSIGHTS>\n-\n-\n</INSIGHTS>\n\nReward function:\n```python\n<CODE>\n</CODE>\n```"
