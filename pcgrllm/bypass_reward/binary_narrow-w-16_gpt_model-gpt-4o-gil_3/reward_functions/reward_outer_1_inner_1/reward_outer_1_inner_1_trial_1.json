If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height)."

Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable\n(3) Write the role of each agent (insight) and comment for each sub-function what the agents characteristics' is determined and how to calculated it.\n(4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.\n(5) Don't write any code outside the `compute_reward` function, only the `compute_reward` is compiled to the environment.\n\n\nReward function:\n```python\n<CODE>\n</CODE>\n```"

    "response": "To design a reward function that encourages the generation of a level resembling the letter 'A', we need to consider the following insights:\n\n1. **Shape Matching**: The reward should be higher when the current level's shape closely matches the target letter 'A'. This can be achieved by comparing the current level's structure to a predefined pattern of 'A'.\n\n2. **Symmetry**: The letter 'A' is symmetric along its vertical axis. The reward function should encourage symmetry in the level design.\n\n3. **Central Peak**: The letter 'A' has a central peak. The reward function should reward levels that have a central peak structure.\n\n4. **Legs of 'A'**: The letter 'A' has two legs extending from the central peak. The reward function should encourage the presence of these legs.\n\nHere's the reward function code implementing these insights:\n\n```python\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    # Define the target pattern for the letter 'A'\n    target_pattern = jnp.array([\n        [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Extract the central part of the current array to compare with the target pattern\n    curr_central = curr_array[5:11, 5:11]\n\n    # Calculate shape matching score\n    shape_match_score = jnp.sum(curr_central == target_pattern)\n\n    # Calculate symmetry score\n    left_half = curr_array[:, :8]\n    right_half = curr_array[:, 8:]\n    symmetry_score = jnp.sum(left_half == jnp.flip(right_half, axis=1))\n\n    # Calculate central peak score\n    central_peak_score = jnp.sum(curr_array[0:3, 7:9] == 2)\n\n    # Calculate legs score\n    legs_score = jnp.sum(curr_array[3:6, [6, 10]] == 2)\n\n    # Combine scores into a total reward\n    reward = shape_match_score + symmetry_score + central_peak_score + legs_score\n\n    # Normalize the reward\n    reward = jnp.tanh(reward / 100.0)\n\n    return reward\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Shape Matching**: We compare a central part of the current level with a predefined pattern of 'A'. The more tiles match, the higher the score.\n- **Symmetry**: We check for symmetry by comparing the left and right halves of the level.\n- **Central Peak**: We reward the presence of a central peak by checking the top center of the level.\n- **Legs of 'A'**: We reward the presence of legs by checking specific positions in the level.\n\nThis reward function encourages the generation of levels that resemble the letter 'A' by rewarding specific structural features."
