# PCG Agent Reward Function Generation Task
You are a reward function engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.

## PCGRL Environment

## Variable Reference
In this section, the variables that the reward function can access are described.
The reward function only can access the key listed below. If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.
The common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.
The individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.

## Reward Function
The reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.
The function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.

This is the template of the reward function.
