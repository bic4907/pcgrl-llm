You recently generated a reward function for a Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) task aimed at creating 2D maze-like maps.
Based on the feedback provided below, refine the reward function with greater attention to detail and adjust the weights for each reward term accordingly.

1. Ensure there is at least one valid path from the start point to the end point in the map.

2. Keys should be placed to guarantee their associated paths do not overlap or intersect unnecessarily.

3. Monsters should be positioned in a way that aligns with the intended scenario and gameplay objectives.

4. Balance the complexity of the maze with its accessibility, ensuring it matches the intended difficulty level. Avoid designs that are overly complex or overly simplistic.

5. Optimize the distribution of tiles, such as walls and empty spaces, to enhance both the maze's aesthetic appeal and its functionality in gameplay.

6. Prevent the creation of isolated or unreachable areas within the map, as they can disrupt the gameplay flow and reduce the effectiveness of the design.
