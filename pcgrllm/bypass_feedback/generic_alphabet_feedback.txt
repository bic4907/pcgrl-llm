You recently generated a reward function for a Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) task aimed at creating 2D maze-like maps.
Based on the feedback provided below, refine the reward function with greater attention to detail and adjust the weights for each reward term accordingly.

1. Ensure the generated maze accurately resembles the intended alphabet shape, with minimal distortion or irregularities.

2. Maintain a clear and valid path structure within the maze, ensuring it aligns with the overall alphabet shape.

3. Optimize the distribution of empty and wall tiles to balance visual clarity and functional navigability of the maze.

4. Prevent unnecessary overlaps or disconnected regions that could hinder the maze's readability as an alphabet.

5. Design the reward function to encourage variety in the generated mazes while maintaining adherence to the target alphabet shape.
