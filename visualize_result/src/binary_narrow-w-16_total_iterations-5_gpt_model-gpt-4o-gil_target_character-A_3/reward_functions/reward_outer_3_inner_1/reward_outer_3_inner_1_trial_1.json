If there are multiple letters, it gets lower score from evaluation.\n\n\n\n## PCGRL Environment\nThe gym-pcgrl project provides an environment for Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL), where agents learn to generate game levels.\nOne of the environments, \"binary,\" involves creating maps using two tile types: empty spaces (1) and walls (2).\nIn the \"narrow\" representation, the agent modifies the map by scanning through it, changing tiles one by one.\nThis localized approach encourages more precise level design.\nThe agent receives rewards based on how well the generated level meets the predefined objectives.\nIf the agent generates a level that aligns closely with the goal\u2014such as creating a functional and balanced map\u2014it receives a higher reward.\nThis reward-driven mechanism incentivizes the agent to improve its design strategies over time, learning to create optimal levels through trial and error.\n\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\n<REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n</REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\n\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To generate diverse shape of target character, if possible, avoid creating \"hard-coded levels\". (e.g., just calculating the hamming distance with the target character)"

Each level is entirely filled with the value `2`, which represents walls, and there are no `1`s to form the structure of the letter \"A\". This indicates that the current reward function is not effectively guiding the model to create the desired pattern.\n\n### Feedback and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Incentivize the Formation of \"A\":**\n   - The reward function should provide a higher reward for configurations that closely match the target pattern of \"A\". Currently, the reward is calculated based on the difference between the current array and the target pattern, but it seems this is not sufficient to guide the model.\n   - Consider increasing the weight of the reward for matching the target pattern to make it more significant compared to other factors.\n\n2. **Adjust Penalty for Excessive Walls:**\n   - The current penalty for excessive use of `1`s (empty spaces) might be too strong or misaligned, leading the model to fill the entire level with `2`s (walls).\n   - Re-evaluate the penalty mechanism to ensure it does not discourage the formation of the letter \"A\". You might want to reduce the penalty or adjust it to only penalize configurations that deviate significantly from the target pattern.\n\n3. **Incorporate Intermediate Rewards:**\n   - Introduce intermediate rewards for partial matches to the \"A\" pattern. For example, reward the formation of diagonal lines or the horizontal line separately, which can guide the model incrementally towards the full \"A\" shape.\n\n4. **Visual Feedback:**\n   - Consider providing visual feedback or a visualization tool to help the model understand the desired pattern better. This can be particularly useful if the model is struggling to conceptualize the target shape.\n\n5. **Increase Exploration:**\n   - If the model is consistently generating the same pattern, it might be stuck in a local optimum. Encourage exploration by introducing randomness or noise in the early stages of training to help the model discover new configurations.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the model towards generating levels that resemble the letter \"A\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1.
