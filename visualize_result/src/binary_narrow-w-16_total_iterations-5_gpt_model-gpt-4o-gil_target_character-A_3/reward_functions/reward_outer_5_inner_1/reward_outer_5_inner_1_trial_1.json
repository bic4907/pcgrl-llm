If there are multiple letters, it gets lower score from evaluation.\n\n\n\n## PCGRL Environment\nThe gym-pcgrl project provides an environment for Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL), where agents learn to generate game levels.\nOne of the environments, \"binary,\" involves creating maps using two tile types: empty spaces (1) and walls (2).\nIn the \"narrow\" representation, the agent modifies the map by scanning through it, changing tiles one by one.\nThis localized approach encourages more precise level design.\nThe agent receives rewards based on how well the generated level meets the predefined objectives.\nIf the agent generates a level that aligns closely with the goal\u2014such as creating a functional and balanced map\u2014it receives a higher reward.\nThis reward-driven mechanism incentivizes the agent to improve its design strategies over time, learning to create optimal levels through trial and error.\n\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\n<REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n</REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\n\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To generate diverse shape of target character, if possible, avoid creating \"hard-coded levels\". (e.g., just calculating the hamming distance with the target character)"

Here are some observations and recommendations for revising the reward function:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Diagonal Lines**: The diagonal lines that form the sides of the \"A\" are not consistently present or aligned in the generated levels. This suggests that the reward for diagonal lines might not be strong enough or correctly positioned.\n\n2. **Horizontal Line**: The horizontal line in the middle of the \"A\" is often missing or incomplete. This indicates that the reward for this feature might need to be increased or better defined.\n\n3. **Size and Proportion**: The generated \"A\" shapes are not large or clear enough. The reward function should emphasize the importance of size and proportion to ensure the \"A\" is recognizable and fills the space appropriately.\n\n4. **Excessive Use of Walls (2s)**: There are too many walls (2s) in the levels, which obscure the \"A\" shape. The penalty for uniform patterns and excessive walls might need to be increased.\n\n5. **Diversity and Empty Spaces**: While diversity is encouraged, the use of empty spaces (1s) should be more structured to form the \"A\" shape rather than random placements.\n\n### Recommendations for Revising the Reward Function:\n1. **Increase Reward for Diagonal Lines**: Enhance the reward for correctly placed diagonal lines that form the sides of the \"A\". Ensure that the reward is sensitive to the correct angle and position of these lines.\n\n2. **Enhance Reward for Horizontal Line**: Increase the reward for the presence of a horizontal line in the middle of the \"A\". This line is crucial for the letter's recognition.\n\n3. **Incorporate Size and Proportion Metrics**: Introduce a reward component that evaluates the size and proportion of the \"A\" to ensure it is large and centered within the level.\n\n4. **Increase Penalty for Excessive Walls**: Strengthen the penalty for levels that have too many walls (2s), as this detracts from the clarity of the \"A\".\n\n5. **Refine Diversity Reward**: Adjust the diversity reward to ensure that empty spaces (1s) contribute to forming the \"A\" rather than being randomly distributed.\n\n6. **Introduce Shape Recognition**: Consider implementing a shape recognition component that specifically checks for the \"A\" pattern and provides a significant reward when the pattern is correctly formed.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the reward function can be more effectively aligned with the goal of generating levels that clearly represent the letter \"A\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1.
