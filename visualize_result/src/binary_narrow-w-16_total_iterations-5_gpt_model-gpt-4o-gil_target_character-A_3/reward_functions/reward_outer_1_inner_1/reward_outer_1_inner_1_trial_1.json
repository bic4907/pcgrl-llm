If there are multiple letters, it gets lower score from evaluation.\n\n\n\n## PCGRL Environment\nThe gym-pcgrl project provides an environment for Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL), where agents learn to generate game levels.\nOne of the environments, \"binary,\" involves creating maps using two tile types: empty spaces (1) and walls (2).\nIn the \"narrow\" representation, the agent modifies the map by scanning through it, changing tiles one by one.\nThis localized approach encourages more precise level design.\nThe agent receives rewards based on how well the generated level meets the predefined objectives.\nIf the agent generates a level that aligns closely with the goal\u2014such as creating a functional and balanced map\u2014it receives a higher reward.\nThis reward-driven mechanism incentivizes the agent to improve its design strategies over time, learning to create optimal levels through trial and error.\n\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\n<REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n</REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\n\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To generate diverse shape of target character, if possible, avoid creating \"hard-coded levels\". (e.g., just calculating the hamming distance with the target character)"
