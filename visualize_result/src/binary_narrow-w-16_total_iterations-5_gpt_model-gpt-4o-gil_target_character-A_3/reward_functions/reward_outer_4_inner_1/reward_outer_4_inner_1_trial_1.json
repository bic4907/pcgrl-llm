If there are multiple letters, it gets lower score from evaluation.\n\n\n\n## PCGRL Environment\nThe gym-pcgrl project provides an environment for Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL), where agents learn to generate game levels.\nOne of the environments, \"binary,\" involves creating maps using two tile types: empty spaces (1) and walls (2).\nIn the \"narrow\" representation, the agent modifies the map by scanning through it, changing tiles one by one.\nThis localized approach encourages more precise level design.\nThe agent receives rewards based on how well the generated level meets the predefined objectives.\nIf the agent generates a level that aligns closely with the goal\u2014such as creating a functional and balanced map\u2014it receives a higher reward.\nThis reward-driven mechanism incentivizes the agent to improve its design strategies over time, learning to create optimal levels through trial and error.\n\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\n<REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n</REWARD_FUNCTION_FORMAT>\n\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To generate diverse shape of target character, if possible, avoid creating \"hard-coded levels\". (e.g., just calculating the hamming distance with the target character)"

All the levels are filled entirely with the value `2`, which represents walls, and there are no empty spaces (`1`) to form the shape of \"A\". Here are some recommendations to revise the reward function:\n\n1. **Increase Reward for Correct Patterns**: The current reward function does not seem to provide enough incentive for creating the diagonal and horizontal lines that form the letter \"A\". Consider increasing the weight of the rewards for matching these specific patterns.\n\n2. **Penalty for Uniform Patterns**: Introduce a penalty for levels that are too uniform, such as those filled entirely with walls. This can help discourage the model from generating levels that do not attempt to form any recognizable patterns.\n\n3. **Encourage Diversity in Patterns**: Add a reward component that encourages diversity in the pattern, such as having a mix of walls and empty spaces. This can help the model explore different configurations that might lead to the formation of the letter \"A\".\n\n4. **Intermediate Rewards for Partial Matches**: While the function already includes intermediate rewards for partial matches, these might need to be adjusted to provide more significant feedback. For example, ensure that partial matches of the diagonal lines and the horizontal line are rewarded more prominently.\n\n5. **Visual Feedback**: Consider implementing a visual feedback mechanism that allows the model to \"see\" how close it is to forming the letter \"A\". This could involve visualizing the difference between the current pattern and the target pattern during training.\n\n6. **Adjust Penalty for Excessive Use of Walls**: The current penalty for excessive use of `1s` (empty spaces) might be too lenient. Consider revising this penalty to ensure that the model does not default to filling the level with walls.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the model towards generating levels that resemble the letter \"A\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1.
