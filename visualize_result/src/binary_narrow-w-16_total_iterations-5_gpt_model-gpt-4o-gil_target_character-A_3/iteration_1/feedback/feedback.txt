The generated levels do not resemble the target letter "A" pattern at all. Each level is filled entirely with 1s, which indicates that the current reward function is not effectively guiding the model to create the desired pattern. Here are some recommendations to revise the reward function:

1. **Incentivize Pattern Formation**: The current reward function calculates the difference between the generated pattern and the target pattern. However, it seems that the model is not being sufficiently penalized for deviations from the target pattern. Consider increasing the penalty for incorrect placements to encourage the model to form the correct pattern.

2. **Encourage Sparsity**: Since the target pattern "A" is sparse (i.e., it has many zeros), the reward function should heavily penalize excessive use of 1s. This can be done by adding a term that penalizes the total number of 1s in the generated pattern, encouraging the model to use 1s more judiciously.

3. **Reward Structure**: The current reward function normalizes the reward by the maximum possible difference. This might not be providing enough granularity in feedback. Consider using a more detailed reward structure that provides incremental rewards for partial matches to the target pattern, such as rewarding the formation of diagonal lines or the horizontal line separately.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: Ensure that the reward function correctly identifies and rewards the formation of the diagonal and horizontal lines that make up the letter "A". This might involve breaking down the pattern into smaller components and rewarding each component separately.

5. **Scaling and Size**: If the generated patterns are too small or too large, consider adjusting the reward function to account for the size of the letter. The reward function should encourage the formation of a well-proportioned "A" that fits within the given grid size.

By implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the model towards generating levels that resemble the target letter "A".
