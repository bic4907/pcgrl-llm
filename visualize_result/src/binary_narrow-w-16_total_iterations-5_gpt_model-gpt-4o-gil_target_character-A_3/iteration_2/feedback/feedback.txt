The generated levels do not resemble the target letter "A" at all. Each level is entirely filled with the value `2`, which represents walls, and there are no `1`s to form the structure of the letter "A". This indicates that the current reward function is not effectively guiding the model to create the desired pattern.

### Feedback and Recommendations:

1. **Incentivize the Formation of "A":**
   - The reward function should provide a higher reward for configurations that closely match the target pattern of "A". Currently, the reward is calculated based on the difference between the current array and the target pattern, but it seems this is not sufficient to guide the model.
   - Consider increasing the weight of the reward for matching the target pattern to make it more significant compared to other factors.

2. **Adjust Penalty for Excessive Walls:**
   - The current penalty for excessive use of `1`s (empty spaces) might be too strong or misaligned, leading the model to fill the entire level with `2`s (walls).
   - Re-evaluate the penalty mechanism to ensure it does not discourage the formation of the letter "A". You might want to reduce the penalty or adjust it to only penalize configurations that deviate significantly from the target pattern.

3. **Incorporate Intermediate Rewards:**
   - Introduce intermediate rewards for partial matches to the "A" pattern. For example, reward the formation of diagonal lines or the horizontal line separately, which can guide the model incrementally towards the full "A" shape.

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Consider providing visual feedback or a visualization tool to help the model understand the desired pattern better. This can be particularly useful if the model is struggling to conceptualize the target shape.

5. **Increase Exploration:**
   - If the model is consistently generating the same pattern, it might be stuck in a local optimum. Encourage exploration by introducing randomness or noise in the early stages of training to help the model discover new configurations.

By implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the model towards generating levels that resemble the letter "A".
