Based on the evaluation of the generated levels, it is clear that the current reward function is not effectively guiding the model to create levels that resemble the letter "A". All the levels are filled entirely with the value `2`, which represents walls, and there are no empty spaces (`1`) to form the shape of "A". Here are some recommendations to revise the reward function:

1. **Increase Reward for Correct Patterns**: The current reward function does not seem to provide enough incentive for creating the diagonal and horizontal lines that form the letter "A". Consider increasing the weight of the rewards for matching these specific patterns.

2. **Penalty for Uniform Patterns**: Introduce a penalty for levels that are too uniform, such as those filled entirely with walls. This can help discourage the model from generating levels that do not attempt to form any recognizable patterns.

3. **Encourage Diversity in Patterns**: Add a reward component that encourages diversity in the pattern, such as having a mix of walls and empty spaces. This can help the model explore different configurations that might lead to the formation of the letter "A".

4. **Intermediate Rewards for Partial Matches**: While the function already includes intermediate rewards for partial matches, these might need to be adjusted to provide more significant feedback. For example, ensure that partial matches of the diagonal lines and the horizontal line are rewarded more prominently.

5. **Visual Feedback**: Consider implementing a visual feedback mechanism that allows the model to "see" how close it is to forming the letter "A". This could involve visualizing the difference between the current pattern and the target pattern during training.

6. **Adjust Penalty for Excessive Use of Walls**: The current penalty for excessive use of `1s` (empty spaces) might be too lenient. Consider revising this penalty to ensure that the model does not default to filling the level with walls.

By implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the model towards generating levels that resemble the letter "A".
