The evaluation of the generated levels indicates that none of the levels closely resemble the target shape of the letter "A" as defined in the reward function. The generated content primarily consists of the value `1`, which does not correspond to the expected structure of the letter "A" (represented by `1` in the target shape) and instead includes a significant number of `2`s, which are not part of the target shape.

### Feedback on the Reward Function:
1. **Matching Criteria**: The current reward function calculates the reward based on the number of matching tiles with the target shape. However, it does not account for the size of the letters. If the letters are too small or not prominent enough, the reward may not reflect the intended design.

2. **Letter Size**: The generated levels do not seem to prioritize the size of the letters. The reward function should be revised to provide a higher reward for larger representations of the letter "A". This can be achieved by incorporating a scaling factor that rewards larger contiguous blocks of `1`s that match the target shape.

3. **Penalty for Non-Matching Values**: The presence of `2`s in the generated levels suggests that the model may be generating unwanted elements. The reward function could be improved by introducing a penalty for non-matching values, which would discourage the generation of values that do not contribute to forming the letter "A".

### Recommendation to Revise the Reward Function:
- Introduce a scaling factor that increases the reward based on the size of the contiguous blocks of `1`s that match the target shape.
- Implement a penalty for any `2`s or other values that do not match the target shape, reducing the overall reward when such values are present.
- Consider adding a threshold for the minimum number of matching tiles required to receive any reward, ensuring that only significant representations of the letter "A" are rewarded.

By making these adjustments, the reward function will better align with the goal of generating a level that resembles the letter "A" in a prominent and recognizable manner.
