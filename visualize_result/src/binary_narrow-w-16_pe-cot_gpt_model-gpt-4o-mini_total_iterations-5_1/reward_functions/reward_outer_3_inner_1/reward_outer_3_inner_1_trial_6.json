However, the evaluation condition specifies that the level should look like the letter \"A\", and while the generated content does match the shape of \"A\", it does not take into account the size of the letters.\n\n### Feedback on the Reward Function:\n1. **Size of Letters**: The current reward function does not explicitly reward larger representations of the letter \"A\". All generated levels are filled with `1`s, which means they are maximally sized, but the reward function should encourage larger letters in a more nuanced way. \n\n2. **Lack of Variation**: The generated levels are uniform and do not provide any variation in the representation of the letter \"A\". This could lead to a lack of creativity in the generated levels. The reward function could be adjusted to encourage more diverse representations of the letter \"A\".\n\n### Recommendation to Revise the Reward Function:\n- Introduce a higher reward for larger letters by adding a condition that checks the size of the letter representation. For example, if the letter \"A\" occupies more than a certain percentage of the grid, provide a significant bonus.\n- Consider adding a penalty for levels that are too uniform or lack variation in the representation of the letter \"A\". This could encourage the agent to explore different configurations while still maintaining the overall shape of \"A\".\n- Adjust the scaling factor for matching tiles to ensure that the reward reflects not just the quantity of matching tiles but also their arrangement and size.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the reward function can better guide the agent to generate levels that not only resemble the letter \"A\" but also do so in a more visually appealing and varied manner.\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 3 / Max Iteration: 5 (60.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
