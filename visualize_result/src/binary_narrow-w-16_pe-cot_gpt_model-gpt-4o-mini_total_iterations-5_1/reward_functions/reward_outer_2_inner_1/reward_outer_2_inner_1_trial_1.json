If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

The generated content primarily consists of the value `1`, which does not correspond to the expected structure of the letter \"A\" (represented by `1` in the target shape) and instead includes a significant number of `2`s, which are not part of the target shape.\n\n### Feedback on the Reward Function:\n1. **Matching Criteria**: The current reward function calculates the reward based on the number of matching tiles with the target shape. However, it does not account for the size of the letters. If the letters are too small or not prominent enough, the reward may not reflect the intended design.\n\n2. **Letter Size**: The generated levels do not seem to prioritize the size of the letters. The reward function should be revised to provide a higher reward for larger representations of the letter \"A\". This can be achieved by incorporating a scaling factor that rewards larger contiguous blocks of `1`s that match the target shape.\n\n3. **Penalty for Non-Matching Values**: The presence of `2`s in the generated levels suggests that the model may be generating unwanted elements. The reward function could be improved by introducing a penalty for non-matching values, which would discourage the generation of values that do not contribute to forming the letter \"A\".\n\n### Recommendation to Revise the Reward Function:\n- Introduce a scaling factor that increases the reward based on the size of the contiguous blocks of `1`s that match the target shape.\n- Implement a penalty for any `2`s or other values that do not match the target shape, reducing the overall reward when such values are present.\n- Consider adding a threshold for the minimum number of matching tiles required to receive any reward, ensuring that only significant representations of the letter \"A\" are rewarded.\n\nBy making these adjustments, the reward function will better align with the goal of generating a level that resembles the letter \"A\" in a prominent and recognizable manner.\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 2 / Max Iteration: 5 (40.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
