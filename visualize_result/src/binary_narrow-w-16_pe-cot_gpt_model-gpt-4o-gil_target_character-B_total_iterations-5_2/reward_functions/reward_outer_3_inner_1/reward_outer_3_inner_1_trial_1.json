If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

This indicates that the levels do not resemble the target letter \"B\" pattern at all. The target pattern requires a significant presence of the value `2` to form the shape of the letter \"B\".\n\n2. **Reward Function Analysis**:\n   - The reward function is designed to compare the current array with a predefined target pattern of the letter \"B\". However, the generated levels show no significant match with this pattern.\n   - The function includes a noise penalty for values other than `1` and `2`, which is appropriate, but the generated levels do not contain such noise.\n   - The symmetry reward is calculated, but since the levels are mostly uniform, this aspect does not contribute significantly to the reward.\n\n### Recommendations to Revise the Reward Function:\n1. **Increase Reward for Correct Pattern Formation**:\n   - Enhance the reward for correctly forming the pattern of the letter \"B\". Consider increasing the weight of the match score to encourage the generation of the correct pattern.\n\n2. **Incentivize Larger Patterns**:\n   - Introduce a reward component that specifically incentivizes larger and more distinct patterns of the letter \"B\". This could involve rewarding the presence of contiguous blocks of `2`s that form the shape of \"B\".\n\n3. **Adjust Symmetry Reward**:\n   - Since the letter \"B\" is not symmetric, consider removing or adjusting the symmetry reward. Instead, focus on rewarding the correct vertical and horizontal alignment of the pattern.\n\n4. **Penalty for Uniformity**:\n   - Introduce a penalty for excessive uniformity (e.g., too many `1`s without sufficient `2`s), as this indicates a lack of pattern formation.\n\n5. **Dynamic Pattern Matching**:\n   - Consider implementing a more dynamic pattern matching approach that can adapt to variations in the size and orientation of the letter \"B\", rather than relying solely on a fixed target pattern.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the generation process towards creating levels that resemble the letter \"B\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 3 / Max Iteration: 5 (60.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
