If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

All the levels generated are filled entirely with the value `1`, which indicates that the reward function is not sufficiently incentivizing the use of the value `2` to form the desired pattern.\n\n### Feedback and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Increase the Reward for Correct Pattern Formation:**\n   - The current reward function calculates a match between the current array and the target pattern, but the weight of this component might not be strong enough to drive the generation towards the desired pattern. Consider increasing the weight of the pattern matching component to make it more influential in the reward calculation.\n\n2. **Adjust the Size Reward:**\n   - The size reward currently adds a small bonus for the presence of `2`s in the array. This component might need to be increased to further encourage the use of `2`s, which are essential for forming the letter \"B\".\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the Uniformity Penalty:**\n   - The uniformity penalty is currently applied based on the proportion of `1`s in the array. This penalty might be too lenient, allowing levels filled with `1`s to still receive a non-zero reward. Consider increasing this penalty to discourage uniform levels that do not attempt to form the target pattern.\n\n4. **Introduce a Stronger Penalty for Lack of Structure:**\n   - Consider adding a penalty for levels that do not have any `2`s, as these are necessary for forming the letter \"B\". This could be a fixed penalty that significantly reduces the reward if no `2`s are present.\n\n5. **Incorporate a Pattern Detection Mechanism:**\n   - Implement a more sophisticated pattern detection mechanism that can identify partial matches or attempts to form the letter \"B\". This could involve checking for specific features of the letter, such as vertical and horizontal lines, and rewarding these features more explicitly.\n\nBy revising the reward function with these recommendations, the agent should be better guided towards generating levels that resemble the letter \"B\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 5 / Max Iteration: 5 (100.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
