If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

This is a good approach, but it seems that the generated levels have some deviations from the target pattern, such as extra or missing \"2\"s in certain rows. Consider increasing the weight of the pattern matching component to ensure a closer resemblance to the target pattern.\n\n2. **Noise Penalty**: The noise penalty is applied for any elements in the array that are not \"1\" or \"2\". This is appropriate, but ensure that the penalty is not too harsh, as it might discourage slight variations that could still represent a valid \"B\" shape. You might want to adjust the penalty factor to balance between penalizing noise and allowing some flexibility.\n\n3. **Uniformity Penalty**: The uniformity penalty is applied based on the proportion of \"1\"s in the array. This could be discouraging the creation of larger \"B\" shapes, as larger shapes might naturally have more \"1\"s. Consider revising this penalty to encourage larger, more defined letters, possibly by reducing its weight or by applying it conditionally based on the overall size of the letter.\n\n4. **Size of the Letter**: The current reward function does not explicitly reward the size of the letter. If the goal is to have a larger representation of \"B\", consider adding a component to the reward function that incentivizes larger letters. This could be done by rewarding the number of \"2\"s in the pattern, as they form the structure of the letter.\n\n5. **Consistency Across Levels**: The generated levels show inconsistency in representing the letter \"B\". This might be due to the reward function not sufficiently differentiating between well-formed and poorly-formed letters. Consider adding a consistency check or a higher reward for levels that maintain the correct pattern across multiple rows.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Increase the weight of the pattern matching component to ensure closer adherence to the target pattern.\n- Adjust the noise penalty to allow for slight variations without overly penalizing them.\n- Revise the uniformity penalty to encourage larger letters, possibly by reducing its weight.\n- Introduce a reward component for the size of the letter to incentivize larger representations.\n- Ensure the reward function can consistently differentiate between well-formed and poorly-formed letters to improve consistency across generated levels.\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 4 / Max Iteration: 5 (80.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
