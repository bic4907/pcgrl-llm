If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

However, the generated levels show variations and deviations from the target \"B\" pattern. The reward function should be revised to account for partial matches and structural similarities rather than exact matches. This can be achieved by implementing a more flexible pattern matching approach that rewards partial matches and penalizes deviations.\n\n2. **Size and Proportion**: The generated levels show inconsistencies in the size and proportion of the letter \"B\". The reward function should be revised to give higher rewards for maintaining the correct size and proportion of the letter. This can be done by incorporating additional metrics that evaluate the overall shape and size of the generated pattern.\n\n3. **Noise and Artifacts**: Some levels contain noise and artifacts (e.g., extra or missing blocks) that disrupt the intended pattern. The reward function should include penalties for such noise and artifacts to encourage cleaner and more accurate representations of the letter \"B\".\n\n4. **Symmetry and Consistency**: The letter \"B\" has a specific symmetry and consistency in its structure. The reward function should be revised to reward symmetrical and consistent patterns, ensuring that the generated content maintains the characteristic features of the letter \"B\".\n\n5. **Adaptive Reward Scaling**: Consider implementing adaptive reward scaling to dynamically adjust the reward based on the degree of match and the presence of desired features. This can help guide the model towards generating more accurate and aesthetically pleasing patterns.\n\nBy addressing these points, the reward function can be improved to better guide the model in generating levels that closely resemble the target letter \"B\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 2 / Max Iteration: 5 (40.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
