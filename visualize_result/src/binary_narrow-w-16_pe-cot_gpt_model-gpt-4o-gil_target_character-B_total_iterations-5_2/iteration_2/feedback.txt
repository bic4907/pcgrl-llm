Based on the evaluation of the generated levels and the provided reward function, here is the feedback:

### Observations:
1. **Level Id 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**: The generated levels are predominantly filled with the value `1`, with very few instances of `2`. This indicates that the levels do not resemble the target letter "B" pattern at all. The target pattern requires a significant presence of the value `2` to form the shape of the letter "B".

2. **Reward Function Analysis**:
   - The reward function is designed to compare the current array with a predefined target pattern of the letter "B". However, the generated levels show no significant match with this pattern.
   - The function includes a noise penalty for values other than `1` and `2`, which is appropriate, but the generated levels do not contain such noise.
   - The symmetry reward is calculated, but since the levels are mostly uniform, this aspect does not contribute significantly to the reward.

### Recommendations to Revise the Reward Function:
1. **Increase Reward for Correct Pattern Formation**:
   - Enhance the reward for correctly forming the pattern of the letter "B". Consider increasing the weight of the match score to encourage the generation of the correct pattern.

2. **Incentivize Larger Patterns**:
   - Introduce a reward component that specifically incentivizes larger and more distinct patterns of the letter "B". This could involve rewarding the presence of contiguous blocks of `2`s that form the shape of "B".

3. **Adjust Symmetry Reward**:
   - Since the letter "B" is not symmetric, consider removing or adjusting the symmetry reward. Instead, focus on rewarding the correct vertical and horizontal alignment of the pattern.

4. **Penalty for Uniformity**:
   - Introduce a penalty for excessive uniformity (e.g., too many `1`s without sufficient `2`s), as this indicates a lack of pattern formation.

5. **Dynamic Pattern Matching**:
   - Consider implementing a more dynamic pattern matching approach that can adapt to variations in the size and orientation of the letter "B", rather than relying solely on a fixed target pattern.

By implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the generation process towards creating levels that resemble the letter "B".
