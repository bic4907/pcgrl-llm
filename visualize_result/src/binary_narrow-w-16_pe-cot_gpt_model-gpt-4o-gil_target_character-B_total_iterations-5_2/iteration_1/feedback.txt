Based on the evaluation of the generated levels, here is the feedback on the reward function:

1. **Pattern Matching**: The current reward function calculates the reward based on the exact match between the generated content and the target pattern. However, the generated levels show variations and deviations from the target "B" pattern. The reward function should be revised to account for partial matches and structural similarities rather than exact matches. This can be achieved by implementing a more flexible pattern matching approach that rewards partial matches and penalizes deviations.

2. **Size and Proportion**: The generated levels show inconsistencies in the size and proportion of the letter "B". The reward function should be revised to give higher rewards for maintaining the correct size and proportion of the letter. This can be done by incorporating additional metrics that evaluate the overall shape and size of the generated pattern.

3. **Noise and Artifacts**: Some levels contain noise and artifacts (e.g., extra or missing blocks) that disrupt the intended pattern. The reward function should include penalties for such noise and artifacts to encourage cleaner and more accurate representations of the letter "B".

4. **Symmetry and Consistency**: The letter "B" has a specific symmetry and consistency in its structure. The reward function should be revised to reward symmetrical and consistent patterns, ensuring that the generated content maintains the characteristic features of the letter "B".

5. **Adaptive Reward Scaling**: Consider implementing adaptive reward scaling to dynamically adjust the reward based on the degree of match and the presence of desired features. This can help guide the model towards generating more accurate and aesthetically pleasing patterns.

By addressing these points, the reward function can be improved to better guide the model in generating levels that closely resemble the target letter "B".
