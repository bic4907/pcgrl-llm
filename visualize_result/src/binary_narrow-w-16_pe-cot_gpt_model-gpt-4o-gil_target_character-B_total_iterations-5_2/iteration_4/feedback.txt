Based on the evaluation of the generated levels, it is clear that the current reward function is not effectively encouraging the creation of a level that resembles the letter "B". All the levels generated are filled entirely with the value `1`, which indicates that the reward function is not sufficiently incentivizing the use of the value `2` to form the desired pattern.

### Feedback and Recommendations:

1. **Increase the Reward for Correct Pattern Formation:**
   - The current reward function calculates a match between the current array and the target pattern, but the weight of this component might not be strong enough to drive the generation towards the desired pattern. Consider increasing the weight of the pattern matching component to make it more influential in the reward calculation.

2. **Adjust the Size Reward:**
   - The size reward currently adds a small bonus for the presence of `2`s in the array. This component might need to be increased to further encourage the use of `2`s, which are essential for forming the letter "B".

3. **Re-evaluate the Uniformity Penalty:**
   - The uniformity penalty is currently applied based on the proportion of `1`s in the array. This penalty might be too lenient, allowing levels filled with `1`s to still receive a non-zero reward. Consider increasing this penalty to discourage uniform levels that do not attempt to form the target pattern.

4. **Introduce a Stronger Penalty for Lack of Structure:**
   - Consider adding a penalty for levels that do not have any `2`s, as these are necessary for forming the letter "B". This could be a fixed penalty that significantly reduces the reward if no `2`s are present.

5. **Incorporate a Pattern Detection Mechanism:**
   - Implement a more sophisticated pattern detection mechanism that can identify partial matches or attempts to form the letter "B". This could involve checking for specific features of the letter, such as vertical and horizontal lines, and rewarding these features more explicitly.

By revising the reward function with these recommendations, the agent should be better guided towards generating levels that resemble the letter "B".
