### Reward Function Inputs
def compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:
    reward = 0.0

prev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers
prev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level
curr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers
curr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level

1. array (jnp.array, int32): {array_shape}
The array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).
The game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.

[Tile Number]
{tile_enum}

- Generate reward function which fills "1" to show alphabet shape in the level.
- Make sure "0" is not present in the generating level array. "0" is reserved for the border padding.

2. stats: (dict[int]): ({stats_keys})
