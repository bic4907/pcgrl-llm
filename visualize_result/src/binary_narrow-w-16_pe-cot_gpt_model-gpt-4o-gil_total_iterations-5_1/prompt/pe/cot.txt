You have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.
The reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.
You can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.
Note the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.
