If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

All the levels generated are completely filled with 1s, which does not match the target pattern of \"A\".\n\n### Feedback and Recommendations:\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The current reward function checks for a specific pattern in the center of the level. However, the generated levels do not seem to be influenced by this pattern recognition. Consider revising the reward function to more strongly penalize deviations from the target pattern.\n\n2. **Incentivize Structure**:\n   - Increase the reward for correctly matching the target pattern and introduce penalties for areas that deviate from the pattern. This can be done by adding a negative reward for each tile that does not match the target pattern.\n\n3. **Size and Position**:\n   - Ensure that the reward function accounts for the size and position of the pattern. If the pattern is too small or not centered, the reward should be adjusted accordingly. Consider scaling the reward based on how well the pattern fits within the level dimensions.\n\n4. **Diversity in Patterns**:\n   - Encourage diversity in the generated patterns by introducing a variety of target patterns or by rewarding unique configurations that still resemble the letter \"A\".\n\n5. **Iterative Feedback**:\n   - Implement a mechanism for iterative feedback where the reward function can adapt based on previous generations. This can help the model learn from past mistakes and improve over time.\n\nBy incorporating these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the generation process towards creating levels that more closely resemble the letter \"A\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 2 / Max Iteration: 5 (40.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"

This encourages the agent to avoid filling the level with 1s indiscriminately.\n2. **Non-Negative Reward**: Ensured that the reward is non-negative by using `jnp.maximum(reward, 0.0)`. This prevents the agent from receiving negative rewards, which can be counterproductive.\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: The reward function now more strongly penalizes deviations from the target pattern, which should guide the agent towards creating a level that resembles the letter \"A\".\n\nThese changes aim to address the feedback by making the reward function more sensitive to the correct pattern and penalizing incorrect configurations."
