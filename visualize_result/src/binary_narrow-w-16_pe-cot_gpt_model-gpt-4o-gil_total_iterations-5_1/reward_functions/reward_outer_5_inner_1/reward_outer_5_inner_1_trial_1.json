If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

However, the generated levels do not clearly represent the letter \"A\" in a recognizable form. This suggests that the reward function may not be effectively guiding the generation process towards the desired pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Size and Scaling**: The target pattern is defined on a 10x10 grid, but the levels are 16x16. This mismatch in scale might be causing the pattern to not be effectively recognized or generated. Consider scaling the target pattern to better fit the 16x16 grid or adjusting the reward function to account for different scales.\n\n3. **Penalty for Deviation**: The current reward function includes a deviation penalty, which might be too harsh, especially if the generated pattern is close to the target but not exact. Consider reducing the penalty or implementing a more nuanced penalty system that allows for partial matches or variations in the pattern.\n\n4. **Incentivizing Larger Patterns**: The generated levels do not seem to prioritize larger, more defined patterns. The reward function should be revised to provide higher rewards for larger, more distinct representations of the letter \"A\". This could involve increasing the weight of the match score relative to the penalty or introducing additional incentives for larger patterns.\n\n5. **Noise and Variability**: The generated levels contain a lot of variability and noise, which might be diluting the focus on forming the letter \"A\". Consider adding a mechanism to the reward function that penalizes excessive noise or rewards more cohesive and consistent patterns.\n\n6. **Pattern Orientation and Positioning**: Ensure that the reward function is flexible enough to recognize the letter \"A\" in different orientations or positions within the grid. This might involve allowing for rotations or translations of the target pattern.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Revise the reward function to better accommodate the scale of the 16x16 grid.\n- Adjust the deviation penalty to be less severe or more adaptive.\n- Increase the reward for larger, more distinct patterns.\n- Consider adding a noise penalty or cohesion reward to encourage clearer pattern formation.\n- Ensure flexibility in pattern recognition for different orientations and positions.\n\nBy addressing these points, the reward function can be better aligned with the goal of generating levels that clearly represent the letter \"A\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 5 / Max Iteration: 5 (100.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
