If the key is not listed below, the reward function cannot access the value.\nThe common variables are the variables that are measured for the overall game state, not for each player.\nThe individual variables are the variables that are measured for each player in the game state.\n\n## Reward Function\nThe reward function is a function that calculates the reward value for the agent based on the playtested results.\nThe function is written in Python and loads the playtested results from the json file and calculates the reward value based on the results.\n\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\n    return reward\n\nThis is the template of the reward function.\n# Tips for Jax code implementation\nThe reward code is written in JAX, a numerical computing library that is similar to NumPy, but with the ability to run on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\nMost of the NumPy functions have been implemented in JAX, but there are some differences and limitations that you should be aware of when writing JAX code.\nThe code is compiled using a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and there are unusable Python constructs in JAX, such as loops and conditionals.\nAlso, the different array shape between input and output could make some errors on methods (e.g., jnp.unique)\n\n### Attempted boolean conversion of traced array with shape bool[].\nThis error occurs when you try to convert a JAX array to a boolean. JAX does not support this operation. You can use `jnp.where` to achieve the same result.\n\n[Before]\nif current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold:\n    diameter_penalty = (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5\n    reward -= diameter_penalty\n\n[After]\njnp.where(current_diameter > diameter_penalty_threshold, (current_diameter - diameter_penalty_threshold) * 0.5, reward)\n[Reward Code Rules]\nImport the necessary library for the reward function code.\n- import jax.numpy as jnp\n\n[Reward Code Tips]\n- Delta reward is calculated by the difference between the current reward and the previous reward to measure the improvement.\n- Write general reward function code that would work in diverse level sizes (width and height).\n- The alphabet is represented in a big size in the game level. If the letter is too small, it cannot recognize the letter.\n- Do not use \"`\", double quotes, and single quotes character in the reward code and notes for the parsing from the response.\n- To create diverse shape of target character, avoid creating hard-coded levels."

Here are some observations and recommendations for revising the reward function:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Pattern Recognition**: The generated levels do not closely match the target pattern of the letter \"A\". The current reward function uses a sliding window approach to find the best match, but it seems insufficient in guiding the model to create a clear and distinct \"A\" shape.\n\n2. **Size and Scale**: The target pattern is relatively small (6x6), and the generated levels are larger (16x16). This size discrepancy might be causing the model to focus on smaller patterns that do not scale well to the larger level size.\n\n3. **Penalty for Deviation**: The deviation penalty is applied uniformly, which might not be sufficient to discourage incorrect patterns. The penalty might need to be more dynamic or context-sensitive.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Increase Pattern Size**: Consider increasing the size of the target pattern to better match the scale of the generated levels. A larger pattern might help the model focus on creating a more distinct \"A\" shape.\n\n2. **Enhance Pattern Matching**: Improve the pattern matching mechanism by incorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as convolutional operations, to better capture the spatial relationships and orientation of the \"A\" pattern.\n\n3. **Dynamic Penalty Adjustment**: Introduce a more dynamic penalty system that increases the penalty for larger deviations or incorrect placements of key features of the \"A\" pattern, such as the crossbar or the symmetry of the legs.\n\n4. **Incorporate Additional Features**: Consider adding additional features to the reward function, such as symmetry checks or specific feature detection (e.g., ensuring the presence of a crossbar), to better guide the model towards creating a recognizable \"A\".\n\n5. **Reward for Larger Patterns**: Encourage the generation of larger, more distinct patterns by providing higher rewards for larger matches of the target pattern, ensuring that the \"A\" is not only present but also prominent in the level.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the reward function should better guide the model to generate levels that more closely resemble the target letter \"A\".\n\n\n               \n\n\n### Reward Function Inputs\ndef compute_reward(prev_array, prev_stats, curr_array, curr_stats) -> float:\n    reward = 0.0\n\nprev_array: jnp.array : previous game level represented with tile numbers\nprev_stats: dict : statistics of the previous game level\ncurr_array: jnp.array : current game level represented with tile numbers\ncurr_stats: dict : statistics of the current game level\n\n1. array (jnp.array, int32): (16, 16)\nThe array is a 2D array with the shape of (height, width).\nThe game level is represented with tile numbers (enum) in the 2D array.\n\n[Tile Number]\nEMPTY = 1, WALL = 2\n\n- Generate reward function which fills \"1\" to show alphabet shape in the level.\n- Make sure \"0\" is not present in the generating level array. \"0\" is reserved for the border padding.\n\n2. stats: (dict[int]): (DIAMETER = 0, N_REGIONS = 1)\n\n\n\n\n## Thought Tips\nYou have to generate the reward function step-by-step in several iterations.\nThe reward function is revised trial-and-error by training the agent and evaluating the generated content.\nYou can get feedback from the reward function every iteration to improve the reward function.\nNote the progress of thought and starts from the simplest reward function to the complex one.\n\n\nCurrent Iteration: 4 / Max Iteration: 5 (80.0%)\n\n\n\n## Output\nReward function:\n```python\n```"
